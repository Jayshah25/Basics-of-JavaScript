// The file describes the concept of Variables in JavaScript.

// The var keyword is used to define a variables.
// Since JS is not a statically typed language, data type declaration of variables is not required.
// However, undefined data type variables can give rise to difficult-to-catch bugs. For this reason, TypeScript was created.

// Lower Case, Upper Case, $ or _ can be used to start a Variable Name (formally called identifier)
